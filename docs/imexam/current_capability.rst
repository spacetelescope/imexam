=====================
imexam User Methods
=====================
These are methods particular to the ``imexam`` package which are meant to aid users
in their image analysis. They are called from the main object you created
with imexam.connect().

At the top library level, the follow commands are available:::

    imexam.connect(): connect to a viewer and return a control object
    imexam.display_help(): Takes you to the help documents for your installed version of imexam
    imexam.defpars: contains the default plotting function dictionaries
    imexam.imexamine: this class contains the plotting functions and can be instantiated by itself
    imexam.set_logging(): set the logging parameters for your session.

Each object has access to it's own logging which can be edited using viewer.setlog()
The following will also be available for those not on a Windows system, where the XPA and DS9 are installed:::

    imexam.display_xpa_help(): Takes you to the XPA help page for DS9
    imexam.list_active_ds9(): returns a dictionary of available DS9 sessions for connection


You can always get the commands available to your local viewer by asking the
control object for them directly. If you called your control object "viewer" then the following example will return the list:::

    viewer.show_window_commands()  # will return a list of available commands

Not all viewers have all commands implemented, commands which are available
but not yet fully implemented should return an error to that affect.

**alignwcs**\ (on=True):
    Align the images in the viewer using the WCS in their headers

        200,200, 2
        300,300, comment 3


        viewer.make_region('test',labels=True)

        And the output region file:

        image; circle(100,100,5)

        image; circle(300,300,5)
        image;text(310.0,310.0{ comment 3 })# font="time 12 bold"


Now let's load the region file into our image:

.. image:: ../_static/make_region.png
    :height: 600

    :alt: image with regions plotted



**mark_region_from_array**\ (input_points,rtype="circle",ptype="image",textoff=10,size=5):

    ::

        locations=list()
        locations.append( (100,100,1) )
        locations.append( (200,200,2) )
        locations.append( (300,300,'comment 3') )

        viewer.mark_region_from_array(locations)

.. image:: ../_static/mark_region.png
    :height: 600
    :width: 500
    :alt: image with regions plotted


**match**\ (coordsys="wcs", frame=True, crop=False, fslice=False,

        In [1]: viewer.readcursor()
        Out[2]: (56.0, 28.333333, 'a')

        or with a click of the first mouse button

        In [1]: viewer.readcursor()
        Out[2]: (67.333333, 80.0, '<1>')


**reopen**\ ():
    Reopen a closed viewing window, mostly used for ginga windows right now

**rotate**\ (value=None, to=False):
    Rotate the current frame (in degrees)

**save_regions**\ (filename=None):
    Save the regions currently displayed in the window to a regions file

**save_rgb**\ (filename=None):
    Save an rgbimage frame as an MEF fits file

**scale**\ (scale='zscale'):
    Scale the pixel values in the window, zscale is the default

**set_region**\ (region_string):
    Use this to send the DS9 viewer a formatted region string it's expecting

For example, in DS9::

    viewer.set_region("text 110.0 110.0 '1' #font=times")


    See the DS9 XPA documentation for more examples.

**show_xpa_commands**\ ():

**snapsave**\ (filename=None, format=None, resolution=100):
    Create a snapshot of the current window in the specified format

**valid_data_in_viewer**\ ():
    Return bool if valid file or array is loaded into the viewer

**view**\ (img, header=None, frame=None, asFits=False):
    Load an image array into the image viewing frame, if no frame is specified,
    the current frame is used. If no frame exists, then a new one is created.
    A basic header is created and sent to DS9. You can look at this header
    with disp_header() but get_header() will return an error because it looks
    for a filename, and no file was loaded, just the array.

    ::

        image_array=fits.getdata('image.fits')
        viewer.view(image_array)

        or

        image_array=numpy.ones([100,100])*numpy.random.rand(100)
        viewer.view(image_array)

**zoom**\ (par=None):
    Zoom using the specified command in par

**zoomtofit**\ ():
    Zoom the image to fit the window

**setlog**\ (self, filename=None, on=True, level=logging.DEBUG):
    Turn on and off ``imexam`` logging to the a file. You can set the filename to
    something specific or let the package record to the default logfile.
    Once you give the object a logfile name, it will continue to use that
    file until you change it.

    ::

        In [5]: viewer.setlog()
        Saving ``imexam`` commands to imexam_log.txt

This is what's displayed in the terminal when you use imexam():

.. image:: ../_static/setlog1.png
    :height: 500
    :width: 600
    :alt: log information to terminal


and this is what shows up in the logfile:

.. image:: ../_static/setlog2.png
    :height: 500
    :width: 600
    :alt: log information to terminal

You can see there are some leftovers from a previous logging session to the
same file. You can toggle logging during a session too:

    ::

        viewer.setlog(on=False)

        #and to turn off even messages to the screen:

        viewer.setlog(on=False,level=logging.CRITICAL)



**unlearn**\ ():
    Reset all the ``imexam`` default function parameters




**plotname**\ ():
    change or show the default save plotname for imexamine

    ::

        In [1]: viewer.plotname()
        imexam_plot.pdf

        In [2]: viewer.plotname('myplot.jpg')
        In [3]: viewer.plotname()
        myplot.jpg

The extension of the filename controls the plot type.



**display_help**\ ():
    Display the help documentation into a webpage from the locally installed
    version. This is done from the main package:

    ::

        In [1]: import imexam

        In [2]: imexam.display_help()
